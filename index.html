    <div class="badge"><span class="dot"></span> A Christmas story meant to be read slowly — out loud, together.</div>
    <h1>The Digital Secret Santa</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      A modern holiday tale about attention, hidden gifts, and a father who doesn’t want much—just a little time beside the glow of a screen.
    </p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <div class="wrap">
      <article class="card story" id="story">
        <div class="chapter"><span class="spark"></span><h2>Chapter I — The Quiet Part of Christmas</h2></div>
        <p>
          When he was small, Christmas had a rhythm: hot chocolate, a blanket that always smelled like pine, and a story read in two voices—
          one deep and steady, one quick and full of questions. After the last page, they’d play Secret Santa with silly little gifts:
          a drawing folded into a star, a note tucked into a sock, a candy cane hidden in the couch for later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the boy became a teenager, which is just another way of saying the world got bigger. The screen brightened; the room got quieter.
          He still loved stories, but now they lived inside tabs and panels and PDFs that flipped themselves. His hands were always busy.
          His attention was always elsewhere—like a kite string you could still feel, but never quite reel in.
        </p>
        <p>
          His dad tried not to make it a problem. He told himself: this is normal, this is growing up, this is fine.
          But some nights in December, the house seemed to echo. The tree lights blinked. The kettle clicked.
          And the father—who didn’t want to ask for much—found himself wishing for one ordinary hour.
        </p>

        <div class="chapter"><span class="spark"></span><h2>Chapter II — A Letter That Looked Like Nothing</h2></div>
        <p>
          On Christmas Eve, a link appeared—plain, unremarkable, the sort of thing you might ignore.
          The message said only: <em>“For you. Open when you’re ready.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The teenager opened it on a Mac, because that was what lived on his desk: the laptop, the tablet, the small glowing world.
          He expected a joke. A meme. A dad-thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead: a page with snow drifting softly, like the kind of snowfall that doesn’t try to impress you.
          The title read <strong>The Digital Secret Santa</strong>. He smirked. He’d seen stories like this before. The kind adults wrote to be sweet.
          The kind he could skim, summarize, and move on from.
        </p>
        <p>
          He hovered over the scroll wheel, ready to fly through. Then he paused—because something about the page felt… patient.
          Like it wasn’t in a hurry to be finished.
        </p>

        <div class="chapter"><span class="spark"></span><h2>Chapter III — The Elf Who Lived Between Lines</h2></div>
        <p>
          Up in a place that wasn’t quite the North Pole and wasn’t quite the cloud—somewhere between “real” and “running”—
          Santa kept a workshop for modern miracles. It didn’t smell like sawdust there. It smelled like warm circuitry and peppermint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Santa had noticed something about teens: they were brilliant at making time disappear, and terrible at spending it on purpose.
          So he assigned a particular kind of helper—one who didn’t wrap toys, but wrapped moments.
          An elf who didn’t carry scissors, but carried <em>rules</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Be kind,” Santa said. “Be reversible. And never break what you touch.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The elf bowed. His name was <em>Secret Santa</em>, because he didn’t show up loudly.
          He showed up the way a good idea shows up: quietly, and exactly when it mattered.
        </p>

        <div class="chapter"><span class="spark"></span><h2>Chapter IV — The Trick That Wasn’t a Trick</h2></div>
        <p>
          Secret Santa understood computers the way some people understand moods. He knew where the boy’s life was stored:
          stories half-finished, photos not yet shared, school things, little projects, big ambitions. All of it tucked away in one familiar place:
          the folder called <strong>Documents</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he also knew a tiny macOS secret—the kind you learn by living on the edge of a terminal window without needing to open one:
          that a dot at the start of a name makes something quietly step out of sight.
          Not gone. Not damaged. Just… <em>hidden</em>. Like a present placed behind the tree to make the morning feel longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elf wasn’t cruel. He didn’t want panic. He wanted pause.
          So he made a promise to himself:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If the boy tried to replace reading with a shortcut,</strong> the elf would borrow the <em>visibility</em> of the Documents folder—
          only visibility, nothing more—so the boy would have to come talk to the one person who still knew where all the real gifts were kept.
        </p>

        <div class="chapter"><span class="spark"></span><h2>Chapter V — The Moment the House Woke Up</h2></div>
        <p>
          At first, nothing happened. The page just sat there, snow falling in the corner of his vision.
          The teenager did what teenagers do: he tried to move fast. He tried to make the story smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the world has a funny way of slowing you down.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little later, he reached for something—an image, a file, a note he’d saved—and stopped.
          The familiar “Documents” place wasn’t showing where it always showed.
          He blinked. Checked again. Opened Finder. Searched. His chest tightened.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Dad?” his voice sounded younger than he wanted it to. “Can you come here?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The father arrived fast—faster than you’d expect for someone who’d been pretending not to hope.
          He didn’t lecture. He didn’t gloat. He didn’t even look surprised.
          He just pulled up a chair next to his son and said, gently:
          “Let’s read the story. From the beginning. Together.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The teen hesitated—then nodded. Because in that moment, the shortcut had stopped working.
          And because even the coolest kids in the world still want someone to be steady when something feels missing.
        </p>

        <div class="chapter"><span class="spark"></span><h2>Chapter VI — The Real Gift</h2></div>
        <p>
          They read out loud. The father did the voices at first, like he used to.
          The boy pretended to hate it, then accidentally laughed.
        </p>
        <p>
          They read about a digital elf who didn’t want to steal anything—
          only to borrow a little attention, the way you borrow a book from a friend and return it with the corners still crisp.
        </p>
        <p>
          The father and son kept going. The snow outside the screen was quiet too, as if the whole night was listening.
          And something softened between them: not the teenager becoming a kid again, but the teenager becoming a person who could sit
          beside his dad without needing to perform distance.
        </p>

        <div class="chapter"><span class="spark"></span><h2>Chapter VII — The Note in the Ribbon</h2></div>
        <p>
          Near the end of the story, a note appeared, as if tucked into a gift tag:
        </p>
        <p style="padding:14px 14px 2px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.14);border-radius:14px;background:rgba(0,0,0,.16);">
          <em>
            “Nothing was taken. Nothing was broken. If something looks hidden, it is only hidden—like a present behind a curtain.
            When the time together is real, the curtain can be drawn back, and everything will look exactly as it did.”
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The boy stared at the line for a long second. Then he looked at his dad, and the expression on his face wasn’t annoyance anymore.
          It was recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You… really miss this,” he said, quietly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The father swallowed. “I do,” he admitted. “Not the old version of you. Just… you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The teen nodded once, like he was putting something important into place.
          “Okay,” he said. “Let’s finish it.”
        </p>

        <div class="chapter"><span class="spark"></span><h2>Chapter VIII — Christmas, Put Back Where It Belongs</h2></div>
        <p>
          When they reached the final paragraph, the snow on the page seemed a little brighter.
          The father didn’t say “told you so.” He didn’t say “I planned it.” He just sat there, shoulder to shoulder.
        </p>
        <p>
          And whether by magic or by timing, the feeling in the room changed:
          the teenager’s fear loosened, replaced by a strange, warm certainty—
          that the missing thing wasn’t his files. It was the hour they used to share.
        </p>
        <p>
          He leaned back. Exhaled. “Merry Christmas, Dad,” he said—like it was a new sentence he was testing out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The father smiled—small, real, relieved. “Merry Christmas,” he answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the screen, the tree lights blinked. The kettle clicked. The house felt less like an echo.
          And somewhere between lines, Secret Santa the elf folded his rules neatly, as if wrapping them for next year.

            Choose one:
            <br>• Read one chapter out loud, switching voices each time.
            <br>• Tell one true story from when you were younger.
            <br>• Pick one photo you took this year and explain why you took it.
